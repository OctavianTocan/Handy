# Feature Specification: Feature Ideas Research Document

**Feature Branch**: `001-feature-ideas-md`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@FEATURE_IDEAS.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Input references a research document, not a single feature
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Document contains 60+ feature ideas across multiple categories
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → CLARIFICATION NEEDED: Which specific feature(s) should be implemented?
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Cannot proceed without feature selection
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Cannot proceed without feature selection
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → Cannot proceed without feature selection
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has uncertainties - feature selection required"
8. Return: BLOCKED (feature selection required)
```

## ⚡ Status: Clarification Required

**The FEATURE_IDEAS.md file is a research document containing 60+ feature ideas**, not a specification for a single feature. This spec cannot proceed without clarification about which specific feature(s) to implement.

**Available feature categories in the research document:**
1. Text replacement system enhancements
2. LLM post-processing integration
3. Smart punctuation and formatting commands
4. Clipboard stacking/history
5. Domain-specific dictionaries
6. Collaborative snippets/macro library
7. Model expansion (new transcription models)
8. Knowledge base integration (Notion, Obsidian)
9. Enhanced replacements system
10. Multi-model switching and benchmarking
11. Voice command language (VCL)
12. Streaming transcription with live edits
13. Multi-language smart switching
14. Workflow automation triggers
15. Context-aware transcription profiles
16. Desktop audio capture with diarization
17. MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
18. Vector embeddings and RAG for transcripts
19. OCR-based learning auto-corrections
20. Full-spectrum audio visualizer
21. Model benchmarking dashboard
22. Output device audio feedback expansion
23. History system export and sync
24. Smart always-on mic with keyword activation
25. Transcription confidence scores
26. Clipboard history integration
27. Tray icon state animations
28. Debug mode power features
29. Post-transcription pipeline architecture
30. GitHub sync integration
31. Intelligent autocomplete system

## [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Feature Selection Required]

**To proceed with specification, please specify ONE of the following:**

### Option 1: Implement a Single Feature
Select one specific feature from the list above. Example:
- "Implement text replacement system enhancements (multi-word replacements)"
- "Add smart punctuation and formatting voice commands"
- "Build clipboard stacking/history with hotkey recall"

### Option 2: Implement a Feature Set
Group related features into a cohesive implementation. Example:
- "Phase 1 text replacement features: multi-word replacements + voice commands + macros"
- "Writing assistant core: text replacements + LLM enhancement + smart formatting"

### Option 3: Prioritize the Research
Create a prioritization and roadmap spec that:
- Categorizes features by effort and impact
- Defines implementation phases
- Aligns with the Writing Assistant Transformation principle (Constitution III)
- Recommends starting point based on user value

**Recommended approach:** Option 3 - Create a prioritization roadmap first, then create individual specs for high-priority features.

---

## Suggested Next Steps

Based on the constitution's **Writing Assistant Transformation** principle, I recommend prioritizing features that move Handy from "dictation tool" to "writing partner":

**High Priority (Aligns with Writing Assistant Vision):**
1. **Text Replacements System** - Core functionality for context-aware assistance
2. **Smart Formatting Commands** - Voice commands for structure (quotes, bullets, etc.)
3. **LLM Post-Processing** - Optional grammar/style enhancement
4. **Context-Aware Profiles** - Different rules per application type

**Medium Priority (Quality of Life):**
5. **Clipboard History** - Recall past transcriptions easily
6. **Collaborative Snippets** - Share macro sets with community
7. **Voice Command Language** - User-defined programmable commands

**Lower Priority (Advanced Features):**
8. **Model Benchmarking** - A/B test different models
9. **Vector Embeddings** - Semantic search across transcripts
10. **MCP Integration** - Advanced workflow automation

## Recommendation

**I recommend creating a separate "Feature Prioritization and Roadmap" spec** that:
1. Analyzes all features in FEATURE_IDEAS.md
2. Scores each by alignment with Writing Assistant Transformation principle
3. Estimates effort using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL)
4. Defines implementation phases
5. Recommends starting with the text replacement system as foundation

Then, create individual feature specs for each priority item (e.g., "002-text-replacements-system").

**Would you like me to:**
- A) Create the prioritization roadmap spec?
- B) Pick a specific feature from the list and create its spec?
- C) Something else?
