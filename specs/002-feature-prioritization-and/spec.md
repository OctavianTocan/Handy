## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

This spec defines a **strategic roadmap** for transforming Handy from a speech-to-text tool into a true writing assistant. It prioritizes 60+ researched features by alignment with the Writing Assistant Transformation principle (Constitution III).

**Output:** A phased implementation plan with clear priorities, effort estimates, and strategic rationale.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a **Handy project maintainer**, I need a clear prioritization framework so I can make strategic decisions about which features to implement first, ensuring each release moves Handy closer to becoming a privacy-focused writing assistant rather than just a dictation tool.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** 60+ feature ideas from research, **When** applying the prioritization framework, **Then** features are scored by Writing Assistant alignment, user value, and implementation effort

2. **Given** the prioritized feature list, **When** organizing into implementation phases, **Then** each phase builds logically on previous phases and delivers incremental user value

3. **Given** a potential new feature, **When** evaluating against the roadmap, **Then** the decision criteria clearly indicate whether it aligns with the Writing Assistant vision

4. **Given** completion of a roadmap phase, **When** reviewing progress, **Then** measurable improvements in writing assistance capabilities are documented

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a high-value feature requires significant architectural changes?
- How does the roadmap adapt if user feedback contradicts prioritization?
- How do we handle features that conflict with the privacy-first principle?
- What if an "approved" feature from FEATURE_IDEAS.md doesn't align with Writing Assistant vision?

**Perfect Alignment:**
- **Phase 1-2 target near-term goals:** Context detection (profiles), smart formatting, command mode
- **Phase 3 targets medium-term goals:** Style memory (autocomplete), multi-modal editing (profiles)
- **Phase 4-5 target long-term goals:** Integration plugins (GitHub, Notion, Obsidian)
- **Non-goals respected:** No cloud-based core transcription, no social features, focused on writing

### Principle IV: Test-Driven Development (TDD) ⚠️
**Requires Discipline:**
- Roadmap doesn't enforce TDD but all features must follow this principle
- Each feature spec (created from this roadmap) must define tests first
- Integration tests for voice commands, LLM enhancement critical
- Contract tests for webhook/MCP integrations

### Principle V: Code Clarity Over Cleverness ✅
**Strong Alignment:**
- Deferred complex features (OCR learning, streaming) until demand proven
- Rejected always-on wake word (privacy/complexity concerns)
- Simple frequency-based autocomplete before complex AI
- LLM enhancement is optional and transparent

---

## Features Explicitly Rejected

### Rejected with Rationale

1. **Cloud Transcription Providers** (OpenAI, AssemblyAI, Deepgram)
   - **Reason**: Conflicts with privacy principle and Handy's local-first identity
   - **Constitution**: Principle III emphasizes privacy as core to identity

2. **Audio Bookmarks & Recording Replay** (except "scratch that")
   - **Reason**: Adds complexity without clear writing assistance value
   - **Exception**: "scratch that" command aligns with editing workflow (include in voice commands)

3. **Smart Always-On Mic with Wake Word** (for now)
   - **Reason**: Privacy concerns, doesn't improve writing quality, quality of life only
   - **Reconsider**: If strong user demand emerges and privacy model proven

4. **Domain-Specific Dictionaries** (for now)
   - **Reason**: Text replacement system handles this more flexibly
   - **Reconsider**: If medical/legal communities request curated dictionaries

---

## Deferred Pending Validation

### Deferred with Conditions

1. **Streaming Transcription with Live Edits**
   - **Condition**: Research if Whisper/Parakeet support streaming inference
   - **Validation**: User feedback indicates demand for real-time display
   - **Timeline**: Phase 5 earliest

2. **Desktop Audio Capture + Diarization**
   - **Condition**: Validate meeting transcription use case distinct from personal writing
   - **Validation**: User surveys show demand for meeting features
   - **Alternative**: Consider as separate mode or plugin (not core)
   - **Timeline**: Phase 5 or separate project

3. **Multi-Language Smart Switching**
   - **Condition**: Validate multilingual user base size
   - **Validation**: User feedback from bilingual/multilingual users
   - **Complexity**: High (per-sentence language detection)
   - **Timeline**: Phase 5 earliest

4. **OCR-Based Learning Auto-Corrections**
   - **Condition**: Privacy UX designed and validated with users
   - **Validation**: Opt-in model, local-only, clear controls accepted by community
   - **Innovation**: Very innovative but requires careful execution
   - **Timeline**: Phase 5, after core features stable

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: LLM Performance Impact**
- **Mitigation**: Make LLM enhancement optional, default off initially
- **Mitigation**: Use instant paste + live enhancement to hide latency
- **Mitigation**: Support local models (Ollama) for speed, cloud for quality

**Risk 2: Context Profile Complexity**
- **Mitigation**: Start with 5 default profiles covering 80% of use cases
- **Mitigation**: Simple YAML config format (not complex UI)
- **Mitigation**: Document profile creation with templates

**Risk 3: Autocomplete Privacy Concerns**
- **Mitigation**: Learn only from voice transcriptions (user already dictated)
- **Mitigation**: Clear opt-in, local-only storage
- **Mitigation**: Export/delete phrase database easily

**Risk 4: Feature Bloat**
- **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to Writing Assistant vision (reject features that don't align)
- **Mitigation**: Modular architecture allows disabling features
- **Mitigation**: Regular constitution compliance reviews

### User Adoption Risks

**Risk 1: Users Don't Configure Replacements**
- **Mitigation**: Pre-populate common replacements (email signatures, code snippets)
- **Mitigation**: Import from community macro library on first run
- **Mitigation**: Tooltip prompts during first transcriptions

**Risk 2: LLM Enhancement Seen as "Magic" (Lack of Trust)**
- **Mitigation**: Instant paste + live enhancement shows before/after
- **Mitigation**: Confidence scores indicate model uncertainty
- **Mitigation**: Always paste raw transcription first (user can interrupt)

**Risk 3: Profile Maintenance Overhead**
- **Mitigation**: Profiles inherit from base (only specify overrides)
- **Mitigation**: App matching is automatic (no manual switching)
- **Mitigation**: Start with defaults, customize only if needed
